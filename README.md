## Abstract
This study presents the development and evaluation of EDSAan, a mobile application designed to assist commuters of the EDSA Carousel bus system in Metro Manila. The app aims to improve the commuting experience by providing real-time bus stop tracking, offline GPS navigation, and location-based notifications. To assess its effectiveness, three main objectives were evaluated: the usability of the app’s interface for EDSA Carousel travel, the functionality of its offline GPS features, and the overall user satisfaction and usability of the app.

Evaluation data were collected through a custom questionnaire and the System Usability Scale (SUS), with a total of 179 valid responses analyzed. The results showed high levels of agreement across all three objectives, with average Likert scale ratings ranging from 4.45 to 4.76 out of 5. The SUS yielded an average score of 85.52, indicating excellent usability. Additionally, the researcher conducted a personal test by using the app across all 24 EDSA Carousel stations, confirming its real-world performance through video documentation.

Overall, the findings suggest that EDSAan is a highly usable and reliable tool for daily commuters, especially those who rely on offline navigation. The app demonstrates strong potential to support urban transportation needs and improve the commuting experience along the EDSA Carousel route.

## Get started

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
